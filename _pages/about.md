  I believe that <b>all available data, even incomplete data and data with missing, incomplete, or partial annotations should be exploited to build robust and flexible machine learning models</b>.

I am primarily interested in computer vision with a focus on medical applications. My main research interests are:
- **Weakly Supervised Learning**: Learning image segmentation and registration using weak labels (partial annotations, scribbles, points).
- **Domain Adaptation**: Transfering the knowledge learned from one modality to another.
- **Representation Learning**: Discovering joint representations of multimodal data to handle incomplete sets of input data at training and inference times.
